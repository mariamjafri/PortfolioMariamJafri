What We’re Building
In this lesson, we’ll use HTML and CSS to make a basic webpage for a website we’re founding.


Mild

Change the name of the restaurant.
Personalize the about section of the restaurant.
Add 2-5 new menu items and round out your restaurant’s offerings.
Add another section to your page - maybe “location” or “contact us” might be good places to start.
Look up an “unordered list in HTML” and see if you can figure out a way to add an unordered list to your about section. If you can’t think of anything to put in the list, you might use these to list out the rules for your restaurant.
Google has style guides which set standards for formatting code in most common markup and scripting languages. The HTML style guide contains conventions for everything from indentation to semi-colons to how to order classnames and attributes. Following them can drastically improve the readbility of your code and make debugging and collaborating more seamless. Spend some time perusing through Google’s Style Guide for HTML and CSS and modify at least two pieces of your code to meet the style guide conventions.
Medium

Using an img element, add a photo of yourself or an avatar you like to the “About” section of the page, and maybe a 1-sentence bio about yourself.

Change the cuisine and all the menu offerings of this restaurant - make it your own. If you want to open up a boba shop instead of a pizza parlor, do that!

Change the color scheme to match the branding you imagine for your restaurant.

If you’re new to CSS, play the first 5-10 levels of CSS Diner to practice writing your own selectors.

Spicy

Add another page called menu.html, and move your menu to that page. Figure out how to create a link from your homepage (index.html) to your menu page.
Add a third page to your site, and link it from your homepage. Try to make sure that the colors, fonts, and general layout is fairly consistent accross all your pages.
Try modifying all of your code for today’s code-along to meet Google’s HTML/CSS Style Guide standards.
